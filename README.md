Prerequiste 

The lab starts a new Node.js project which serves as the basis for the following courses. Every week, incremental features are completed toward the creation of a working application.

In the end, it becomes the basis for your final project. The final grade reflects the delivered project, as well as its Git history.
Before starting

    Install an IDE or a text editor, for example, Atom or VS Code.
    Install Git, use for installation:

    Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/
    Linux: https://git-scm.com/download/linux
    macOS: https://git-scm.com/download/mac

    Install Node.js by referring the prerequisites.
    Open a command-line interface:

    macOS or Linux: use Terminal
    Windows: use Git Bash (should be installed when installing Git). Note! Don't use default CMD.exe, because it has different commands from a command line of the Linux OS, which is used in most IT environments.


It is working on the localhost:8080
You can use path like "localhost:8080/" to start the website after u start the nodejs script in your terminal with "npm run start" or "npm run dev" for editing
You have different path :
	- "localhost:8080/" give u information on this application
	- "localhost:8080/hello?name==choose_name" say hello [choose_name] in the application
	- "localhost:8080/hello?name==Hugo" an introduction of myself
	- all other path redirect you to an error 404 no mesaeg found
